  <h2 class="alt">I'm a researcher in the Key Laboratory of Geographic Information Science (Ministry of Education), East China Normal University, Shanghai, China. Our lab focuses on artificial intelligence, big data and cloud computing. We aim to replicate human visdom at large scale with our algorithms. In other words, our lab wants to design the eyes and brains of robots. That would make computers to understand the environment around us with big geospatial data. For more information or if you are interested in a internship, master or PhD position at our Lab, contact Dr. Xi Chen.
